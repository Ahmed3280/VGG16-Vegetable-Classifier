# VGG16-Vegetable-Classifier
This project implements a vegetable image classifier using VGG16 pretrained on ImageNet. The dataset contains 15 vegetable classes.

âœ¨ Key highlights:

ğŸŸ¢ Fine-tuned VGG16 by unfreezing the last 2 layers for the first model.

ğŸŸ¢ Fine-tuned VGG16 by unfreezing the last 10 layers for the second model.

ğŸŸ¢ Achieved Test Accuracy: 99.83% on the second model.

ğŸŸ¢ Used PyTorch for model training, validation, and testing.

ğŸŸ¢ Visualized learning curves for loss and accuracy.

ğŸ’¡ Purpose: Demonstrates the power of transfer learning and selective fine-tuning for image classification tasks.
